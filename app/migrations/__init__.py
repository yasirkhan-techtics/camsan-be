# Database migrations package
#
# Migration files should be numbered sequentially:
#   001_description.py
#   002_description.py
#   etc.
#
# Each migration file should have a run_migration() function.
#
# To run all migrations:
#   cd app
#   python migrations/run_migrations.py
#
# To run a single migration:
#   cd app
#   python -m migrations.001_add_llm_verification_columns
